#  Student mobile usage detection and fine management system in restricted areas using deep learning techniques.

## Project Overview
In this project, we have developed an advanced system for enhancing campus discipline
and security. This system employs deep learning techniques to detect unauthorized mobile
phone usage in restricted areas, capturing real-time images. It also features facial recognition
technology to associate individuals with their unique IDs. When a violation is detected, the
system sends instant notifications to the respective Head of Departments (HODs), including
visual proof. This project demonstrates our expertise in data collection, model training,
computer vision, and notification system implementation. It prioritizes privacy and ethics
while utilizing technology to maintain a secure learning environment, making it a valuable
addition to our institution's student management framework.
